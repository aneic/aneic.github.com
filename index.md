### Ancient Near-East Ivory Clustering

This code identifies stylistically similar groups in a corpus of Levantine ivory statuettes using maximum likelihood and maximum posterior clustering. 

Data may be read from a CSV file. Each row is interpreted as a separate observation. Numerical columns are assumed to be real-valued, string-valued columns are assumed to be categorical.
