While it has been written with the application to art historical data in mind, it may be used generally to perform clustering data with a combination of categorical and real-valued features, where some data may be missing. \r\n\r\nData may be read from a CSV file. Each row is interpreted as a separate observation. Numerical columns are assumed to be real-valued, string-valued columns are assumed to be categorical.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Read the Code\r\n\r\nThe repository [aneic-core](https://github.com/aneic/aneic-core) contains the sources for the statistical algorithm, as well as the levantine corpus dataset.\r\n\r\nThe repository [aneic-scripts](https://github.com/aneic/aneic-scripts) contains support code needed in order to perform analysis of the Levantine corpus. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Example Usage\r\n\r\n        git clone https://github.com/aneic/aneic-scripts.git\r\n        cd aneic-scripts/130317_01_mfm_sigma_1.0_a_2.0\r\n        git clone https://github.com/aneic/aneic-core.git\r\n        python run_mfm.py\r\n\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nThis project is both open data and open source. \r\n\r\nThe [levantine corpus](https://github.com/aneic/aneic-core/tree/master/data) dataset is copyright 2013 Amy Gansell (@amygansell).
